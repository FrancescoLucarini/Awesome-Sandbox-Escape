# ProcrastinatorProgrammer
## I may have procrastinated.

This may be a mistake.

Or mistakes were made.

I may have procrastinated security for `procrastinate.2021.sunshinectf.org 65000`. I may have been watching too many Tom Cruise movies instead of releasing this... uh... last year.

But don't worry! The keys to the kingdom are split into three parts... you'll never find them all!

Flag will be given by our backend in the standard `sun{}` format, but make sure you put all the pieces together!

## Notes

Need help on your math? If so? ProcrastinatorProgrammer is _your_ buddy!

Send equations our way, and we'll solve them your way!

## Example Usages

Send an equation, like
```python
cos(5) + sin(7)
```
and we'll send an answer! In this case, `0.9406487841820153`.

Need more complicated equations? No problem! Our python3 backend can handle anything you throw at it.

```python
fsum([.1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1, .1]) + gcd(19,29,39,49,59,69)
```
=>`2.0`

Note: In the future we may disable components if we find there's security issues with them.
